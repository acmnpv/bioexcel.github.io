## Best Practice Guides

These _best practice guides_ have been developed by BioExcel:

* [Biomolecular QM/MM with CP2K](https://docs.bioexcel.eu/qmmm_bpg/) [[suggest changes](https://github.com/bioexcel/qmmm_bpg)]
* [GROMACS Best Practice Guide](https://docs.bioexcel.eu/gromacs_bpg/)  [[suggest changes](https://github.com/bioexcel/gromacs_bpg)] 
  - incl. [GROMACS Performance Cookbook](https://docs.bioexcel.eu/gromacs_bpg/en/master/cookbook/cookbook.html)
* [Creating workflows with Common Workflow Language](/cwl-best-practice-guide/) [[suggest changes](https://github.com/bioexcel/cwl-best-practice-guide)]
* [HADDOCK best practice guide](https://www.bonvinlab.org/software/bpg/) [[suggest changes](https://github.com/haddocking/haddocking.github.io/tree/master/software/bpg)]
* [How to choose which CWL workflow engine to deploy](/cwl-engine-guide/) [[suggest changes](https://github.com/bioexcel/cwl-engine-guide)]
* [Packaging BioCompute Objects using RO-Crate](https://biocompute-objects.github.io/bco-ro-crate/) [[suggest changes](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/bco-ro-crate/)]

These guides are under development:
* [Primer on workflow packaging and metadata standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XREgfYNi7l4HbdrnXBs7Uv1tMH2AiR435SKjisu4l30/edit#) [[suggest changes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XREgfYNi7l4HbdrnXBs7Uv1tMH2AiR435SKjisu4l30/edit)]
* _Alchemical free energy calculations based on non-equilibrium sampling_

In addition to general best practice guidance the guides reflect experience built up over time using the codes and workflow tools in specific application areas. Individual researchers may therefore need to tailor this guidance to find the best approach in light of their particular circumstances and use cases.  

### Contributing to guides

Most of these guides are developed openly as **living documents**, and we **welcome contributions** and suggestions for improvements. 

See _suggest changes_ links above where you can raise an _Issue_ or submit changes as a _Pull Request_ with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

If you prefer, you can instead suggest changes to the guides by posting a question in the [BioExcel forum](https://ask.bioexcel.eu/). Please include the URL to the relevant page.

#### Editing with GitHub

Some of the pages are edited using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), if you are new to GitHub or contributing to Open
Source you may appreciate the [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/) like
[Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/),
[MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [How to
contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

In short:

* Register/log in to <http://github.com/>
* Open corresponding "suggest changes" repository link above.
  - Navigate to the `*.md` or `*.rst` file corresponding to the rendered HTML file. 
  - You may need to go into `docs/` subfolder.
* Click "ðŸ–‰ Edit" to edit file within GitHub UI. GH will make a _branch_ in a _fork_ repository stored under your own account.
* Add/change text
  - Use the corresponding [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [reStructured Text](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) syntax
  - If not sure, just use **plain text**.
* Commit, briefly summarize your changes, e.g. _Fixed download link_
  - Commit often so changes are small!
  - For larger edits/reorganization, instead raise an _Issue_ to discuss best way forward
* Raise a _Pull Request_ (PR) to suggest we incorporate changes from your branch.
  - In the PR description, briefly summarize your changes.
  - Respond to comments/email notifications in case we have any questions
* Further unrelated changes? Make a new PR with a new branch.

Guides BPG1 and BPG2 are rendered using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) which uses the format [reStructured Text](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html), similar to MarkDown.

To update _this_ documentation index page <https://docs.bioexcel.eu/>, edit [index.md](https://github.com/bioexcel/bioexcel.github.io/blob/main/docs/index.md) at <https://github.com/bioexcel/bioexcel.github.io>



### Asking BioExcel

If you have a question not answered by the guides or the code documentation, or you have suggestions for our best pratice guides, 
you may also contact us on the [BioExcel forum](https://ask.bioexcel.eu/).

You can also use the BioExcel forum to suggest changes to the guides.
